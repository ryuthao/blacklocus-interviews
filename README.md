This repository holds interview questions that are written in Java.
The solution is already coded out.

Please self-contain the interview question to one Java class file if possible.
If not possible, create a subdirectory.

Please use the name of the interview question as the name of the class file: `{InterviewQuestion.java}`

Code unit tests for the interview question and solution.
